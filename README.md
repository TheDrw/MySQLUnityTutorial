# SQLUnityTutorial

This is the finished tutorial from Board to Bits. https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5KbKbJ6Gf99mcmE1ptsn0oXO1_vnKDlS
I noticed people got stuck at the user login, so hopefully my finished project can help them.
I didn't do all of tutorial from part 6, which was doing finishing touches. It isn't too important and isn't game breaking.
This was done in Unity 2018.1.3.1f1. Board to Bits was in Unity 2017, so my guess that version change caused problems, maybe. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯


I added a high score table thing as a small exercise for myself. If you wanted to do that but got stuck, you can take a look.
There are a lot of questions I have about PHP because this is my first time using PHP, so I'm not familiar with certain conventions and nuances of the language.
I also added some scripts where if the user doesn't have at least 5 people in the table, it will insert 5 "random" people into the table.
I did change some things around in the C#/Unity side, so you might need to poke around if you are looking at it. 
But the php files should, for the most part, be the same as the tutorial. 
I did change some variable name conventions because it was confusing me without some sort of marker in variable names(ie: varname vs var_name).
Again, not sure if that's the "standard" or what-not.
